# BindingOfIsaacSecretRoomFinder
This is a python application that allows you to enter the map of the level by clicking on the grid, then click the "Find secret rooms button" and it will show you all possible areas where there could be secret rooms or super secret rooms. This allows you to check them individually for if they are possible in game (such as not blocked by a rock)

If you would like to use this program or use the code for making bigger projects, feel free, but some credit (to JackDarkability or Jack Newton, either is fine) would be appreciated.
